**Intro**

This is my submission for my interview challenge. This is a mock webpage that can take in email addresses and store them in a database. 
To make it I used HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and Javascript. Express and node.js frameworks were used on the server side. 

**Installation**

To use this webpage, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/jabiesel/InterviewChallenge.git

2. Install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

npm install

3. Start the server by running the following command:
node index.js

4. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the webpage.

5. Enter an email address in one of the email fields, and click the "Submit" button.

6. The email address will be recorded in a JSON file located in the data directory of the project.

**Additional Section**

Regardless of the outcome, thank you for offering me this challenge. It was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. 
I know, my submission isn’t quite perfect but I wanted to submit it in a timely manner rather than keep you waiting as I tinkered with some of the smaller styling aspects.
I’m a bit embarrassed that I couldn’t get the email forms to match the design you gave me but I did the best I could. The website is responsive and mobile-friendly for the most part. 
I had some trouble with the large IronSoftware logo (I couldn’t get it to stick to the edge of the page without destroying the layout I had already built and the same goes for the nav bar).
I already know how I would approach these problems differently if I were to try again but like I said, I didn’t want to keep you waiting too long. 
Thank you again. I really enjoyed this. I hope to hear from you soon!
